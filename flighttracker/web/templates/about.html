        <h2 class="plain-text">About the project</h2>
        <div class="plain-text">MyFly is a service, providing real-time access to air traffic data.
            It was created based on The OpenSky Network project open API.  </div>
        <h2 class="plain-text">How it works</h2>
        <div class="plain-text">
            <p>Information is provided in the form of State Vectors. The state of an aircraft is a summary of all
                tracking information at a certain point in time.
                These states of aircraft can be retrieved as state vectors in the form of a JSON object.</p>
            <p>As soon as a message of an airplane arrives at servers, OpenSky Network creates a record for the aircraft –
                the so called State Vector. All information required to track the airplane, including its identity
                (ICAO address + call sign), time information (Unix timestamps), and spatial information
                (position, velocity, heading, …) will be represented in this state vector.</p>
            <p>So what happens if OpenSky don't receive any position or velocity update for a while? If the
                last known position of the airplane is not older than 15 seconds, it will be just reused.
                If we do not know any prior position or if the last known position is too old (>15s),
                the position information in the state vector will be omitted.
                The same applies for velocity information.</p>
            <p>If OpenSky doesn't receive any position or velocity update for a duration of 15 seconds, the state
                vector is considered obsolete and the API won’t return any further state vector
                for the respective airplane.</p>
            <p>All vectors represent the state of a vehicle with the interval [time−1,time].</p>
            <p>An OpenSky user is anybody who uses a valid OpenSky account to access the API.
                The rate limitations for OpenSky users are:</p>
            <p>OpenSky users can retrieve data of up to 1 hour in the past. If the time parameter has a value
                t less than now−3600 the API will return 400 Bad Request.
                OpenSky users can retrieve data with a time resultion of 5 seconds.
                That means, if the time parameter was set to t,
                the API will return state vectors for time t−(t mod 5).</p>
